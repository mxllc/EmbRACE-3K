I see two large storage racks, one primarily on the left-hand side and center of my view, and another further back on the right-hand side. The task refers to the 'left storage rack', so I'll focus on the one on the left-hand side. It has multiple wood boxes on its shelves. I need to get closer to identify the correct shelf and box.

I see a wood box on the bottom shelf on the left-hand side of my view, and another one further along the shelf towards the center/right-hand side.
